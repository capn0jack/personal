#For a DBA:
CREATE USER 'cmccabe'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'gG3ODy5gFs2ThGnjVa3k';
#In reality this will choke on one or more system DBs (e.g. information_schema) in RDS, so it'll have to be DB-by-DB (e.g. caredfor.*):
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON _so.* to 'cmccabe'@'%';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON assessments.* to 'cmccabe'@'%';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON caredfor.* to 'cmccabe'@'%';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON caredfor_admin.* to 'cmccabe'@'%';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON cm_service.* to 'cmccabe'@'%';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON connect_sms.* to 'cmccabe'@'%';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON integrations.* to 'cmccabe'@'%';

#And probably this to grant the ability to grant:
grant grant option on  shoutoutdwbi.* to 'tkline'@'%';

#Or the fancy-looking way that Terry wants to do it:
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, DROP, RELOAD, PROCESS, REFERENCES, INDEX, ALTER, SHOW DATABASES, CREATE TEMPORARY TABLES, LOCK TABLES, EXECUTE, REPLICATION SLAVE, REPLICATION CLIENT, CREATE VIEW, SHOW VIEW, CREATE ROUTINE, ALTER ROUTINE, CREATE USER, EVENT, TRIGGER ON *.* TO 'tkline'@'%' WITH GRANT OPTION
